  ☐ constraining policy
      ☐ CORRECT: correct chosen action in environment dynamically
      ☐ PENALIZE: update the reward in environment dynamically
      ☐ CORRECT_AT_POLICY: correct chosen action in policy
        ☐ If constrained policy playable, play it get all constrained actions
          ☐ If the initial policy's output action is one of them -> pick the intial policy's one and process the rest normally
          ☐ Else, pick one randomly and skip saving in history, reward...
        ☐ Else, only the initial policy should be played
