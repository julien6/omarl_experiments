    "#### Typical use case\n",
    "For example, if you are given a set of agents acting for a football team that has to score a goal against an enemy team, you have several choices to implement the joint-policy depending on the level of constraining:\n",
    " - In the least constrained case, you may choose to let them learn the best way to organize themselves without any indication $\\rightarrow$ It is regular MARL where agents may find some very empiric over-fitted solution in the beginning, and it generally takes a lot of time for a joint-policy to become more general by training on differently generated environments. In that case, some collective structured patterns may appear that are naturally fitted on the long term: roles such as goalkeeper, defender, attacker... may appear in someway.\n",
    " - In the most constrained case, you may choose to tell what agents must do in every circumstances $\\rightarrow$ Indeed it is just creating a hand-crafted joint-policy and there is no learning.\n",
    " - Between these two ends, you may also choose agents to learn within a restricted search space you think to be relevant to speed up the converging towards a partially defined joint-policy $\\rightarrow$ Some agents may be forced to be close to the goal cages while other may be forced to go to the front or forcing: you can expect some roles to appear to attack and some other ones to defend.\n",

    "For each joint-history GOSIA computes the state transition graph that is merged into a general one. Measuring the distance between two vectorized states within K-means enables finding the clusters of trajectories that some agents may follow. Then, we sampled some sets of states for each trajectory as goals. For instance, one may choose the narrowest set of states in which agents collectively seem to transition at some point to achieve their goal. Otherwise, a balanced sampling over lower variance trajectories could be made. Knowing what goal belongs to what trajectory, GOSIA infers plans for choice and sequence only.\n",
    "\n",
    "This enables getting goals and plans at a global state but these goals could be indeed split into specific goals for each sub-group and agent. To do this, GOSIA conducts the same process replacing the states with the observations of the agents in the same sub-group for sub-groups, and observations for agents.\n",
